# System-Information-And-Performance-Monitor
The objective of developing a system information and performance monitor using Power BI is to 
provide users with a comprehensive and intuitive dashboard that enables them to monitor and analyze key
performance metrics of their computer systems.
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:
1. Centralized Monitoring: The system information and performance monitor aims to create a
centralized platform where users can access and view various performance metrics of their systems.

2. Real-time Performance Monitoring: The dashboard should provide real-time monitoring
capabilities, allowing users to track system performance metrics in real-time. Real-time data enables
users to detect performance anomalies and take immediate action to address them, ensuring
continuous system health and preventing disruptions.

4. Historical Data Analysis: In addition to real-time monitoring, the system information and
performance monitor should provide access to historical data. Historical data analysis enables users
to identify performance trends, patterns, and seasonality.

6. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): The dashboard should present essential KPIs related tosystem
performance, such as CPU usage, memory utilization, disk activity, and network performance.
